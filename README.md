# random
Alea.js is the original seeded random function by Johannes Baagøe.

I've rewrote 😊 :
- random.js
- random.php


## Soon
 - int32 method
 - double method
 - custom min - max (works with positive and negative numbers) (the only condition : type of min/max === numbers and min < max) ~ OK for node.js and browser version
 - custom number type / range (integer, float) ~ OK for node.js and browser version

... what else ?
